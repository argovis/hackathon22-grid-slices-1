# Argovis Hackathon 2022 - Slices of Gridded Products (group 1)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/argovis/hackathon22-grid-slices-1/HEAD)

Here's a mostly-empty repo for your group to collect their work in. Some notes:

 - the `environment.yml` file is the same one the Argovis team uses to set up its notebooks, and is a good starting place to begin building from. Click on the Binder badge above to be taken to a working Jupyter notebook environment, or use it to start your own environment locally if you're familiar with conda and notebooks.
 - See https://argovis.github.io/hackathon22-docs/index.html for docs on Argovis' API, datastructures, and other useful info.
